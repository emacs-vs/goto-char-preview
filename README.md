Normally `goto-char` will just ask for input of the character position then once 
you hit `RET`; it will just go to that character position. This package makes this
better by navigating the character position while you are inputting in minibuffer.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

Call it from `minibuffer` directly,
```
M-x goto-char-preview
```
Or you can bind it globally to replace `goto-char`:
```el
(global-set-key [remap goto-char] 'goto-char-preview)
```
